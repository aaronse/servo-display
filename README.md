  This code was written to power the WTD 1.0 (Wood Tile Display) project 
  created while participating in Mark Rober's 
  https://monthly.com/mark-rober-engineering course.

  ## WTD 1.0 Code
  [src/wtd_1/wtd_1.ino](src/wtd_1/wtd_1.ino)
  - Displays Wave pattern by default.  Pause/Resume by sending "1" via Serial Monitor.  Edit _mode to change default start mode.
