## Troubleshooting

Problem: 
- Servos were incorrectly configured to move too far, the constant load caused spike in current draw that seems to have burned out regulators, and maybe caused other damge too.
- After smelling burning servos stop responding.
Tried:
- Used thermal CAM to identify hotspots, found regulators varied between 40 deg and 150 deg.  The 150 deg and other high temp regulators are visibly fried.
- Checked PSU voltage is ok, measures as 5V.

Problem/fix: Got a Dead pixel no problem, just replace the ~$2 Servo.
